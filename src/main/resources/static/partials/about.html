<h1 class="page-header">About CAssess</h1>

<div>
    <p>The focus of this research project is to create a platform that provides continuous, formative feedback for
        student working in a project based course. These projects utilize Agile methods, specifically Scrum to
        conduct the projects. Scrum is an excellent process model for student in an agile learning setup as it
        embodies a philosophy of establishing a rhythm to weekly and even daily activities.</p>

    <p>However, assessing student activity in an agile, project based course can have its own shortcomings including
        increased costs for the instructor, delayed feedback and possibly a drop in student compliance. The primary
        motivation of the Continuous Assessment program is is to gauge project activity and provide real time,
        formative feedback to enhance learning experience and ensure compliance in project-based courses.</p>
    <p>The specific innovation evaluated in this project, is the use of visualizations and notifications to ensure
        student compliance with the learning process. Students can view their progress via online tools on a daily
        basis and get regular notifications if they fall behind the expected progress. The initial version of the CA
        platform supports the integration of 3 tools: GitHub for source code management, and Scrumwise or Taiga for
        Scrumboards. These tools were chosen as they provide the most important collaborative functionality for
        supporting software products and organizing a teamâ€™s work.</p>

<h2 class="sub-header">Continuous Assessment</h2>
<div>
    <p>Continuous assessment in educational research is defined as the practice of performing frequent assessments in
        a course context. The practice has become popular in constructivist approaches to (project-based) learning,
        as frequent assessment provides a feedback mechanism ensuring student are properly aligned with a scaffold
        learning process. It remains an active area of research, with an ongoing debate surrounding the utility of
        formative versus summative continuous assessment.</p>

    <p>Continuous assessment in a university course tends to follow a scaffold learning process, albeit assessing
        at a much higher frequency than coarse-grained learning processes typical of a traditional, prescriptive
        university course. We see the Agile concept of continuous integration and testing, realized in a software
        technology platform, as a direct means to perform continuous assessment.</p>

    <p>The current platform is a web-based integration platform (as seen below) composed of two subsystems, each with
        its own user-facing components. The primary component, CAssess (short for Continuous Assessment), provides
        features for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Integrating data streams from open tool APIs</li>
        <li>Performing basic statistical analysis</li>
        <li>Displaying visualizations and notifications to student and instructors</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The second and supporting system is called Nicest (Nicely Integrating Complex Education Software Together),
        and has primarily responsibilities for user and team management, and for provisioning the various tools
        being integrated into CAssess, again via open APIs.</p>
